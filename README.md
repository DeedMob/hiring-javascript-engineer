JavaScript Engineering Skill Exercises
==========================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in working with us!

Our team works exclusively with JavaScript, and tasks can include anything from writing "plain" JavaScript to building full web applications with a framework, and from frontend to backend. As a team, we value communication, trying new things, and sharing knowledge. Core concepts for us include manipulating data and working with React and Flux/Redux. Therefore, we have designed the following to be as relevant as possible to the type of things you will be working with.


Instructions
------------
- There are a few exercises below. You don't have to do every one, but the more you do helps us get a better idea of your experience. Or, describing how you would implement or providing psuedocode is also helpful.
- Each file has some instructions. Feel free to modify the files when you submit it back and to structure your files/code in any way you like.
- You can use any online resources (as long as they are available for us).

**Things to consider**
- Please be considerate while coding and consider how your code might be read/understood by other people.
- We're not fans of jQuery ðŸ˜‚
- We prefer ES6!
- If you have any questions or suggestions, please ask or let us know!

Exercises
-----

1. [Markup](markup.md)
2. [Dog App](dogApp.md)
3. [Small Functions](./functions) - These are the least important to us, but we have included them because they're small exercises that can get interesting in various approaches.
