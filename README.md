GumGum - JavaScript Engineering Skill Test
==========================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome! Thank you for your interest in working on the GumGum JavaScript Engineering team!

Our team works exclusively with JavaScript, and tasks can include anything from writing "plain" JavaScript to building full web applications with a framework, and from frontend to backend. As a team, we value communication, trying new things, and sharing knowledge. Core concepts for us include manipulating data and working with React and Flux/Redux. Therefore, we have designed the following to be as relevant as possible to the type of things you will be working with.

**What's important for us?**

- You are honest. It's OK to say _I don't know_.
- You are a team player. Please be considerate while coding and consider how your code might be read/understood by other people.
- Pay attention to the details.
- If you have any questions or suggestions, please ask!

Instructions
------------

- Read these instructions and each of the tests carefully before you start to code.
- You DON'T need to complete ALL of the tests. But the more you do helps us get an idea of your experience.
- If you do have React experience, please complete Dog App.
- You can also submit a more high level view of the challenges you don't get to, describing how you would implement, or providing psuedocode.
- Each folder has some instructions. Feel free to modify the files when you submit it back. Feel free to structure your files/code in any way you like.
- We will use internet-enabled computers while reviewing your work, so don't hesitate to use online resources (as long as they are available for us).
- We have an [internal design system](http://ds.gumgum.com/stable/css/). Feel free to use it on your code!
- Please let us know an ETA for your test.
- Please don't use jQuery.
