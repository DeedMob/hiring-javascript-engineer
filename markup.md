Generate Markup
==========================================
We have a web app that allows users to create responsive ads, and then we generate their ad markup and output it as a string. The following simulates the experience.

There are two sets of data below: containers and assets. Think of these as what you may get back as data from the API.

Each container represents one media query. Each asset belongs to at least one container.

The goal of this challenge is to create a function that outputs a string representing the given data as HTML.

When feeding the string to a browser (document.write), each media query should look like this when resizing the browser:
[Small](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gumgum-content-dev/interviews-js/ab-challenge-breakpoint-1.png)
[Medium](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gumgum-content-dev/interviews-js/ab-challenge-breakpoint-2.png)
[Large](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gumgum-content-dev/interviews-js/ab-challenge-breakpoint-3.png)

You will be evaluated by the approach taken, readability, and code efficiency (both of your function and its output).

For extra points, don't use inline styles on the elements.

```
const containers = [
    {
        id: 44,
        width: 300,
        name: 'Small'
    },
    {
        id: 54,
        width: 500,
        name: 'Medium'
    },
    {
        id: 78,
        width: 900,
        name: 'Large'
    }
];

const assets = [
    {
        id: 4,
        width: 300,
        height: 300,
        body: 'https://dog.ceo/api/img/corgi-cardigan/n02113186_11685.jpg',
        x: 20,
        y: 50,
        z: 2,
        containers: [44, 54, 78]
    },
    {
        id: 10,
        width: 260,
        height: 380,
        body: 'https://dog.ceo/api/img/corgi-cardigan/n02113186_3457.jpg',

        containers: [78]
    },
    {
        id: 45,
        width: '100%',
        height: 100,
        body: '#0fa0db',

    },

        width: '100%',
        height: 150,
        body: '#43E0BC',
